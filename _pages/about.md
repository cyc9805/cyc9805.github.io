I'm a Master's candidate at the [NLP&AI Lab](https://nlp.korea.ac.kr/) at Korea University, advised by [Heuiseok Lim](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HMTkz7oAAAAJ). My research covers several areas, including representation learning, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), uncertainty estimation, and automatic speech recognition (ASR). Working across different modalities has given me a broad perspective on solving complex problems. Over time, my various experiences have converged toward one key challengeâ€”the trustworthiness of AI. Currently, my work focuses on developing trustworthy AI systems for large pretrained models.
